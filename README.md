 “Building the future one line of code at a time.”

Currently, I am a dotNet developer as well as a Python developer at Tweaking Technologies, Jaipur.</li>
I am a computer science graduate from Lakshmi Narain College of Technology, Bhopal. I have worked as a data scientist intern at Forsk Coding School, Jaipur. I also published a research paper for my project, ATM Security Enhancement Using Computer Vision (CV).

Technology excites me, and I am always in awe of the change it drives in the world. Certain skills with which I have worked include ASP.NET, Windows Presentation Framework (WPF), Python, Django, Sqlite, and Tkinter. And what I might lack in skills, I make up for with my determination to learn. I am also working for some clients to build their websites in Django.

Outside of tech, I am a gamer, and I like planting plants.
